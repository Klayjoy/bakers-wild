Possibly 4 since so wide, or a fanned out group of cards with dessert photos? Will only be for index. Per youtube guy's example, should I do img class? Think might be nice to style image banner photos easily-->

        <p class="hello">What is <em>Baker's Wild bakery and cafe</em> all about?<p>
            
        <p> In addition to being a cozy place for one to enjoy a delicious dessert, paired up with a hot beverage, we add a wildcard twist to our menu every week. You, the customer, get to decide which flavor or style our featured weekly dessert must have. Hence the name, Baker's Wild!</p>
        
      
        <p>For example, we may end up with a lemon merengue pie that has passion fruit instead of lemon, or in addition to lemon. Or a tiramisu with spicy chai latte instead of espresso. How about a peanut butter and jelly cupcake...with pineapple!?</p>
        
        <p>To vote for next week's wildcard flavor, just click <a href="gallery.html">here</a> or click on the Winners Gallery link to vote and browse through our previous winners. You can also fill out at a form in-store. Just ask our friendly staff for assistance.</p> 
        
        
        <p>Need to have a function catered? No problem. Stop in or call for an estimate. We look forward to seeing you at Baker's Wild! Come on in a try our featured 'Wild Card'.</p> 
        
        <p>Bon Appetit!</p>
