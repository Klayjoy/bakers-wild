Possibly 4 since so wide, or a fanned out group of cards with dessert photos? Will only be for index. Per youtube guy's example, should I do img class? Think might be nice to style image banner photos easily-->

        <p class="hello">What is <em>Baker's Wild bakery and cafe</em> all about?<p>
            
        <p>It's casual place where, one can enjoy delicious desserts and drinks, but where every week our customers get to decide what our featured dessert will be like. We do a survey where we offer a few choices (wildcards!) that will determine what the featured dessert will be like every week. Whether it's an odd flavor combination or a deconstructed dessert...you get the picture! </p>
        
      
        <p>For example, we may end up with a lemon merengue pie that has passion fruit instead of lemon, or in addition to lemon. Or a tiramisu with spicy chai latte instead of esspresso. How about a peanut butter and jelly cupcake...with pineapple!</p>
        
        <p>To vote for next week's wildcard flavor, just click <a href="gallery.html">here</a> or click on the Winners Gallery to vote and browse through our previous winners. Good luck and bon appetit!</p>
        
      
        <p>So come on by for our featured wild card special!!</p>
